# PopularMovies
An Android app that allows users to discover the most popular and top-rated movies, powered by TheMovieDB API.

## Getting Started
<p>An API key is required to access TheMovieDB API, and you'll need to provide your own to run the app.</p>

<p>If you haven't got one already:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup">Sign up to TheMovieDB here.</a></li>
<li>Once you have your API key, create a file called <code>key.properties</code> under the <code>/app</code> directory.</li>
<li>In this new file, enter your API key like this: <code>TMDBAK = &quot;&lt;Your API Key Here&gt;&quot;</code>.</li>
</ol>
